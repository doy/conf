Take my love, take my land
Take me where I cannot stand
I don't care, I'm still free
You can't take the sky from me

Take me out to the black

Burn the land and boil the sea
You can't take the sky from me

There's no place I can be
Since I found Serenity
But you can't take the sky from me...

her handsome prince... "

River: (continuing) "... to fight through the terrible ivy of thorns
and climb up to her room and slay all the wicked, evil demons... "

River: (much later, sweetly sing-songy) "And then the beautiful princess
got tired of waiting for her handsome prince and tried to escape, but
they found her and to punish her they locked her in a smelly, white,
cold room where the evil blue demons strapped electrodes to her face
and started to shock her. Zap, zap, zap, until she couldn't stop
screaming. Only no one could hear."

(River remains smiling; the kids not so much.  In fact, they're just a
little bit freaked out by the story and by the freaky lady telling it)
