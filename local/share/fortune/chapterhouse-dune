When I set out to lead humanity along my Golden Path I promised a lesson their 
bones would remember.  I know a profound pattern humans deny with words even 
while their actions affirm it.  They say they seek security and quiet, 
conditions they call peace.  Even as they speak, they create seeds of turmoil 
and violence.

The person who takes the banal and ordinary and illuminates it in a new way can 
terrify.  We do not want our ideas changed.  We feel threatened by such 
demands.  "I already know the important things!" we say.  Then Changer comes

You cannot know history unless you know how leaders move with its currents.  
Every leader requires outsiders to perpetuate his leadership.  Examine my 
career:  I was leader and outsider.  Do not assume I merely created a 
Church-State.  That was my function as leader and I copied historical models.  
Barbaric arts of my time reveal me as outsider.  Favorite poetry:  epics.  
Popular dramatic ideal:  heroism.  Dances:  wildly abandoned.
Stimulants to make people sense what I took from them.  What did I take?
The right to choose a role in history.

Confine yourself to observing and you always miss the point of your own life.  
The object can be stated this way:  Live the best life you can.  Life is a game 
whose rules you learn if you leap into it and play it to the hilt.  Otherwise, 
you are caught off balance, continually surprised by the shifting play.  
Non-players often whine and complain that luck always passes them by.  They 
refuse to see that they can create some of their own luck.

All governments suffer a recurring problem:  Power attracts pathological 
personalities.  It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the 
corruptible.  Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a 
condition to which they are quickly addicted.

Religion (emulation of adults by the child) encysts past mythologies:  guesses, 
hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, pronouncements made in search of 
personal power, all mingled with shreds of enlightenment.  And always an 
unspoken commandment:  Thou shalt not question!  We break that commandment 
daily in the harnessing of human imagination to our deepest creativity.

They say Mother Superior can disregard nothing -- a meaningless aphorism

Enter no conflict against fanatics unless you can defuse them.
Oppose a religion with another religion only if your proofs (miracles)
are irrefutable or if you can mesh in a way that the fanatics accept
you as god-inspired.  This has long been the barrier to science assuming
a mantle of divine revelation.  Science is so obviously manmade.
Fanatics (and many are fanatic on one subject or another) must know where
you stand, but more important, must recognize who whispers in your ear.

 History in a news account?  Preselected at an editorial conference, digested

history.  Diaries, memoirs and autobiographies are subjective forms of special
