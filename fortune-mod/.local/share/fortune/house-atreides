In response to the strict Butlerian taboo against machines that perform mental

safe path through foldspace, and the Mentats, whose computerlike minds are

The paintbrush of history has depicted Abulurd Harkonnen in a most unfavorable 
light.  Judged by the standards of his older half brother, Baron Vladimir, and 
his own children Glossu Rabban and Feyd-Rautha Rabban, Abulurd was a different 
sort of man entirely.  We must, however, assess the frequent descriptions of 
his weakness, incompetence, and foolhardy decisions in light of the ultimate 
failure of House Harkonnen.  Though exiled to Lankiveil and stripped of any 
real power, Abulurd secured a victory unmatched by anyone else in his extended 
family:  He learned how to be happy with his life.
