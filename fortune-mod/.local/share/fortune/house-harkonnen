Before us, all methods of learning were tainted by instinct.  Before us, 
instinct-ridden researchers possessed a limited attention span -- often no 
longer than a single lifetime.  Projects stretching across fifty or more 
generations never occurred to them.  The concept of total muscle/nerve training 
had not entered their awareness.  We learned how to learn.

"Xuttuh" is a word that means many things.  Every Bene Tleilax knows it was the 
name of the first Master.  But just as that man was more than a mere mortal, so 
there are depths and complexities in the appellation.  Depending upon tone and 
vocal inflection, "Xuttuh" can mean "hello" or "blessings be upon you."  Or it 
can constitute a prayer encompassed in a single word, as a devotee prepares to 
die for the Great Belief.  For such reasons, we have chosen this as our new 
name for the conquered planet formerly known as Ix.

It is said that the Fremen has no conscience, having lost it in a burning

is almost stronger than his sense of self.  It is only to outsiders that these

Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child.  Religion is the 
encystment of past beliefs:  mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden 
assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made 
in search of personal power . . . all mingled with shreds of enlightenment.  
And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is "Thou shalt not question!"
But we do anyway.  We break that commandment as a matter of course.
The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination,
the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity.
